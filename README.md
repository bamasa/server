Wonderland
========

Development setup
---

Basically you need to do `dep ensure` (see [dep](https://github.com/golang/dep))

After that set `WONDERLAND_CONFIG` to some YAML file path, with contents similar to:

```
server_cert: /path/to/server/cert.crt
server_key: /path/to/server/key.key
ca_cert: /path/to/ca/cert.crt
listen_on: :50051
db_uri: postgres://localhost/wonderland?sslmode=disable
```

After that you can launch server with `go run wonderland_server.go` command

In order to run tests, you'll need to point `WONDERLAND_TESTS_CONFIG` env variable to some YAML file with contents like:
```
client_cert: /path/to/client/cert.crt
client_key: /path/to/client/key.key
ca_cert: /path/to/ca/cert.crt
connect_to: 127.0.0.1:50051
db_uri: postgres://localhost/wonderland?sslmode=disable
```


Certificates
---

TLS auth supoort is inspired by this article: https://bbengfort.github.io/programmer/2017/03/03/secure-grpc.html

Full certificate creation workflow using [certstrap](https://github.com/square/certstrap) looks like this
```
# For server
certstrap init --common-name "wonderland"
certstrap request-cert -ip 127.0.0.1
certstrap sign 127.0.0.1 --CA wonderland
```
`-o` parameter used to provide structured data in format `access_to_project.access_to_jobkind` (two strings separated by `.`)  
You could provide a certain job access using `access_to_project=[project_name / ANY]` and `access_to_jobkind=[kind_name / ANY]` (`ANY` for full access )
```
# For client
certstrap request-cert -o ship-shield.docker --cn test-user
certstrap sign test-user --CA wonderland
```
Examples
---

to generate client `csr` for user (name "test-user", access to project "ship-shield" and access to any kind of jobs) execute following
```
certstrap request-cert -o ship-shield.ANY --cn test-user
```
to generate client `csr` for docker (name "docker", access to any project and access to "docker" kind of jobs) execute following
```
certstrap request-cert -o ANY.docker --cn docker
```
to generate client `csr` for user (name "alex", access to any project and access to any kind of jobs) execute following
```
certstrap request-cert -o ANY.ANY --cn alex
```
